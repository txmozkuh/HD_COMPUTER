// Here we have 3 partials connecting up to our main.scss.

// Base: contained within this file are all your resets, variables, mixins, and any utility classes.

// Layout: contains all the CSS that handles the layout, such as the container and any grid systems.

// Components: anything reusable such as buttons, navbars, cards etc.

// Main: it should ONLY contain the imports for the above files.
